//#region The task

// This is about complexity management again. When the objects in my system are fixed, stable things, I can consider operations on them in isolation—moving to Alice’s house from a given start state always produces the same new state. When objects change over time, that adds a whole new dimension of complexity to this kind of reasoning.
